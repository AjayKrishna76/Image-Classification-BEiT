# Image Classification with BEiT
BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Image Transformers) from the paper **BEIT: BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers**. This repository contains my work in using the cutting-edge BEiT model, a novel approach to pre-training image transformers inspired by the successes of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in natural language processing.

# Introduction
BEiT introduces a powerful paradigm in image classification by adapting the successful strategies of BERT to visual content. The fundamental concept of BEiT, similar to BERT, involves pre-training a transformer model using a self-supervised learning approach. This involves masking parts of the input – in the case of BEiT, patches of an image – and training the model to predict the missing pieces.

# Similarities between BERT, ViT, and BEiT
BEiT shares several key similarities with BERT and ViT (Vision Transformer), which underline its innovative design:
- **Transformer Architecture**: Like ViT, BEiT utilizes a transformer architecture, which BERT originally popularized for text-based tasks. This architecture excels in handling the relationships between different parts of the input data, whether they are tokens in a sentence or patches in an image.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: BEiT and BERT both use self-supervised pre-training techniques. BERT masks words or tokens in a sentence and predicts them during training, while BEiT masks image patches and predicts their content, adapting the concept to the visual domain.
- **Bidirectional Context**: BEiT, similar to BERT, processes inputs bidirectionally, allowing the model to learn rich contextual representations from both preceding and succeeding elements. For images, this means understanding the context of surrounding image patches to predict the content of masked ones.
